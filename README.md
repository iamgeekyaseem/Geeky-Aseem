# Portfolio Project

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. Below is an overview of the technologies and tools used in this project and the reasons for choosing them.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **React.js**
- **Why:** React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable components, making the development process efficient and scalable.

### 2. **Tailwind CSS**
- **Why:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a highly customizable and efficient way to style components. It reduces the need for writing custom CSS and speeds up the design process.

### 3. **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Why:** Modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals make the code more concise and readable.

### 4. **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **Why:** These are the foundational technologies for structuring and styling the web pages.

### 5. **Vite**
- **Why:** Vite is a fast build tool and development server that improves the development experience with its lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR).

### 6. **Font: Space Grotesk**
- **Why:** This font was chosen for its modern and clean look, aligning with the overall design aesthetic of the portfolio.

### 7. **Animations (CSS Keyframes)**
- **Why:** Keyframe animations are used to add visual appeal and interactivity to the website, such as loading animations and reveal effects.

### 8. **Responsive Design**
- **Why:** Ensures the website is accessible and visually appealing on devices of all sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
